# Python3D-PocketMineCraft

This project is an alpha version of application which is a hybrid of Minecraft and a mobile game Pocket Mine with ursina engine. 

## Technologies and major libraries:

- Python 3.9.1
- [ursina engine 3.4.0](https://www.ursinaengine.org/#Getting%20Started)

## Alpha version features:

- You are enclosed in mine area surrounded by undestructible blocks.
- Your main task is to dig and collect resources until your pickaxe breaks.
- There are 3 types of destructible blocks: dirt, stone and coal ore.
- Resources are converted to money which you can be spend to upgrade your pickaxe and let you dig longer.

## Launching:

Personally, I launch the game in Visual Studio Code with installed extension for Python by choosing Run -> Start debugging/Run without debugging.
However the game should also start by simply executing command `py main.py` in root directory
